Advance Steel 2013 is not only a powerful tool for modelling and detailing, but also a Building Information Modeling (BIM) software that enables you to collaborate more easily with other stakeholders in the design and construction process. You can import and export data from Revit software or Robot Structural Analysis software, and use the bi-directional link to synchronize changes and updates. You can also share your model with contractors using Navisworks software or BIM 360 Glue software, and perform clash detection and coordination.
 
Another benefit of Advance Steel 2013 is that it helps you optimize your steel fabrication workflow and reduce costs. You can use ready-to-use templates to generate high-quality shop drawings and bills of materials, and customize them to suit your standards and preferences. You can also export data to CNC machines for accurate and efficient fabrication. Advance Steel 2013 supports various international standards and codes, such as EC3 and American Standards, for steel connection checking and verification.
 
Advance Steel 2013 also helps you create lighter and stronger steel structures by using advanced lightweighting materials, such as advanced high-strength steel (AHSS). AHSS is stronger and more ductile than typical steel, and could reduce component weight by up to 25 percent, particularly in strength-limited designs such as pillars and door rings. AHSS is generally compatible with existing manufacturing and materials currently used in vehicles, and can improve fuel efficiency and safety.
